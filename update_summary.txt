about.html: <h2>About Me</h2><p>Hi, I’m Alex Francisco. I'm a stroke survivor, which has left me disabled and unable to pursue my past interest in hiking until I can fully recover. I was born in '82 and live in the 4-corners region of the southwest. This disability has required me to adapt to a new daily life where I can only use my right hand, even though I was predominantly left-handed. AI technology has been instrumental in helping me navigate and improve my daily life in this new reality.</p>
